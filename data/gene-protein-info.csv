Ubiquitination of CCS leads to enhancement of its chaperone activity toward its physiologic target, SOD1, rather than proteasomal degradation (PubMed:20154138). Ubiquitination of MAP3K2/MEKK2 and AIFM1 does not lead to proteasomal degradation (PubMed:17967870, PubMed:22103349). Plays a role in copper homeostasis by ubiquitinating COMMD1 and promoting its proteasomal degradation (PubMed:14685266). Can also function as E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase of the NEDD8 conjugation pathway, targeting effector caspases for neddylation and inactivation (PubMed:21145488).

At the nucleoplasmic side of the NPC, Ran binds to the importin, the importin/substrate complex dissociates and importin is re-exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm where GTP hydrolysis releases Ran. The directionality of nuclear import is thought to be conferred by an asymmetric distribution of the GTP- and GDP-bound forms of Ran between the cytoplasm and nucleus (By similarity). Mediates the nuclear import of UBC9, the RBM8A/MAGOH complex, PAX6 and probably other members of the paired homeobox family.

,,P63010,AP2B1_HUMAN,AP2B1,Homo sapiens,"Component of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2). Adaptor protein complexes function in protein transport via transport vesicles in different membrane traffic pathways. Adaptor protein complexes are vesicle coat components and appear to be involved in cargo selection and vesicle formation. AP-2 is involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis in which cargo proteins are incorporated into vesicles surrounded by clathrin (clathrin-coated vesicles, CCVs) which are destined for fusion with the early endosome. The clathrin lattice serves as a mechanical scaffold but is itself unable to bind directly to membrane components. Clathrin-associated adaptor protein (AP) complexes which can bind directly to both the clathrin lattice and to the lipid and protein components of membranes are considered to be the major clathrin adaptors contributing the CCV formation. AP-2 also serves as a cargo receptor to selectively sort the membrane proteins involved in receptor-mediated endocytosis. AP-2 seems to play a role in the recycling of synaptic vesicle membranes from the presynaptic surface. AP-2 recognizes Y-X-X-[FILMV] (Y-X-X-Phi) and [ED]-X-X-X-L-[LI] endocytosis signal motifs within the cytosolic tails of transmembrane cargo molecules. AP-2 may also play a role in maintaining normal post-endocytic trafficking through the ARF6-regulated, non-clathrin pathway. During long-term potentiation in hippocampal neurons, AP-2 is responsible for the endocytosis of ADAM10 (PubMed:23676497). The AP-2 beta subunit acts via its C-terminal appendage domain as a scaffolding platform for endocytic accessory proteins; at least some clathrin-associated sorting proteins (CLASPs) are recognized by their [DE]-X(1,2)-F-X-X-[FL]-X-X-X-R motif. The AP-2 beta subunit binds to clathrin heavy chain, promoting clathrin lattice assembly; clathrin displaces at least some CLASPs from AP2B1 which probably then can be positioned for further coat assembly.",The primary biological pathway involving the protein AP2B1 (AP2B1_HUMAN) is clathrin-dependent endocytosis.

The eIF-3 complex associates with the 40S ribosome and facilitates the recruitment of eIF-1, eIF-1A, eIF-2:GTP:methionyl-tRNAi and eIF-5 to form the 43S pre-initiation complex (43S PIC). The eIF-3 complex stimulates mRNA recruitment to the 43S PIC and scanning of the mRNA for AUG recognition. The eIF-3 complex is also required for disassembly and recycling of post-termination ribosomal complexes and subsequently prevents premature joining of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits prior to initiation (PubMed:17581632). The eIF-3 complex specifically targets and initiates translation of a subset of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation, including cell cycling, differentiation and apoptosis, and uses different modes of RNA stem-loop binding to exert either translational activation or repression (PubMed:25849773).",The primary biological pathway that involves the protein EIF3H (EIF3H_HUMAN) is the **eukaryotic translation initiation pathway**.
,,Q9H0R8,GBRL1_HUMAN,GABARAPL1,Homo sapiens,"Ubiquitin-like modifier that increases cell-surface expression of kappa-type opioid receptor through facilitating anterograde intracellular trafficking of the receptor (PubMed:16431922).

While LC3s are involved in elongation of the phagophore membrane, the GABARAP/GATE-16 subfamily is essential for a later stage in autophagosome maturation (PubMed:20404487). Through its interaction with the reticulophagy receptor TEX264, participates in the remodeling of subdomains of the endoplasmic reticulum into autophagosomes upon nutrient stress, which then fuse with lysosomes for endoplasmic reticulum turnover (PubMed:31006537, PubMed:31006538).",The primary biological pathway that involves the protein GBRL1_HUMAN (GABARAPL1) is autophagy.

Extracellular stimuli such as pro-inflammatory cytokines or physical stress stimulate the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAP/JNK) signaling pathway. In this cascade, two dual specificity kinases MAP2K4/MKK4 and MAP2K7/MKK7 phosphorylate and activate MAPK9/JNK2 (PubMed:10376527, PubMed:15805466, PubMed:17525747, PubMed:19675674, PubMed:20595622, PubMed:21364637, PubMed:22441692, PubMed:34048572). In turn, MAPK9/JNK2 phosphorylates a number of transcription factors, primarily components of AP-1 such as JUN and ATF2 and thus regulates AP-1 transcriptional activity (PubMed:10376527). In response to oxidative or ribotoxic stresses, inhibits rRNA synthesis by phosphorylating and inactivating the RNA polymerase 1-specific transcription initiation factor RRN3 (PubMed:15805466). Promotes stressed cell apoptosis by phosphorylating key regulatory factors including TP53 and YAP1 (PubMed:17525747, PubMed:21364637). In T-cells, MAPK8 and MAPK9 are required for polarized differentiation of T-helper cells into Th1 cells (PubMed:19290929). Upon T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, is activated by CARMA1, BCL10, MAP2K7 and MAP3K7/TAK1 to regulate JUN protein levels (PubMed:19290929). Plays an important role in the osmotic stress-induced epithelial tight-junctions disruption (PubMed:20595622).

LUBAC conjugates linear polyubiquitin to IKBKG and RIPK1 and is involved in activation of the canonical NF-kappa-B and the JNK signaling pathways (PubMed:17006537, PubMed:19136968, PubMed:20005846, PubMed:21455173, PubMed:21455180, PubMed:21455181, PubMed:22863777, PubMed:28189684). Linear ubiquitination mediated by the LUBAC complex interferes with TNF-induced cell death and thereby prevents inflammation (PubMed:21455173, PubMed:28189684). LUBAC is recruited to the TNF-R1 signaling complex (TNF-RSC) following polyubiquitination of TNF-RSC components by BIRC2 and/or BIRC3 and to conjugate linear polyubiquitin to IKBKG and possibly other components contributing to the stability of the complex (PubMed:20005846, PubMed:27458237). The LUBAC complex is also involved in innate immunity by conjugating linear polyubiquitin chains at the surface of bacteria invading the cytosol to form the ubiquitin coat surrounding bacteria (PubMed:28481331, PubMed:34012115). LUBAC is not able to initiate formation of the bacterial ubiquitin coat, and can only promote formation of linear polyubiquitins on pre-existing ubiquitin (PubMed:28481331). Recruited to the surface of bacteria by RNF213, which initiates the bacterial ubiquitin coat (PubMed:34012115). The bacterial ubiquitin coat acts as an 'eat-me' signal for xenophagy and promotes NF-kappa-B activation (PubMed:28481331, PubMed:34012115). Together with OTULIN, the LUBAC complex regulates the canonical Wnt signaling during angiogenesis (PubMed:23708998).

,,Q9Y230,RUVB2_HUMAN,RUVBL2,Homo sapiens,"Possesses single-stranded DNA-stimulated ATPase and ATP-dependent DNA helicase (5' to 3') activity; hexamerization is thought to be critical for ATP hydrolysis and adjacent subunits in the ring-like structure contribute to the ATPase activity (PubMed:10428817, PubMed:17157868, PubMed:33205750). Component of the NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex which is involved in transcriptional activation of select genes principally by acetylation of nucleosomal histones H4 and H2A (PubMed:14966270). This modification may both alter nucleosome -DNA interactions and promote interaction of the modified histones with other proteins which positively regulate transcription (PubMed:14966270). This complex may be required for the activation of transcriptional programs associated with oncogene and proto-oncogene mediated growth induction, tumor suppressor mediated growth arrest and replicative senescence, apoptosis, and DNA repair (PubMed:14966270).
